# Cybersecurity Practice Questions with Explanations

## 1. Which tool is most commonly associated with state actors?

**Answer:** Advanced Persistent Threat (APT).

**Explanation:** APTs are used by state-sponsored attackers to conduct long-term, sophisticated attacks on critical infrastructure, governments, or corporations. These attackers often have significant resources and can remain undetected for extended periods while they gather intelligence or disrupt systems.

## 2. What is an objective of state-sponsored attackers?

**Answer:** Espionage, Sabotage, Influence Operations, Intellectual Property Theft, Surveillance.

**Explanation:** State-sponsored attackers aim to gather intelligence, disrupt operations, or gain strategic advantage by compromising government, military, or corporate targets. Their goals often include political or economic gains for their sponsoring nation.

## 3. Luna is reading a book about the history of cybercrime. She read that the very first cyberattacks that occurred were mainly for what purpose?

**Answer:** Curiosity, experimentation, or showing off technical skills.

**Explanation:** Early cyberattacks were often carried out by hobbyists or individuals exploring the capabilities of the technology, rather than for financial or political gain, as is more common today.

## 4. How do vendors decide which should be the default settings on a system?

**Answer:** Security, Usability, Performance Optimization, Compliance, User Demographics, Feedback, and Testing.

**Explanation:** Vendors aim to balance security with ease of use, compliance with regulations, and optimal performance. Defaults are often chosen to minimize risk while ensuring the product is accessible to a wide range of users.

## 5. Which of the following groups use Advanced Persistent Threats?
  - Shadow IT
  - Criminal syndicates
  - Brokers
  - State actors

**Answer:** State actors.

**Explanation:** APTs require significant resources and sophistication, which are typically available only to nation-states. Criminal syndicates and others may use advanced techniques, but APTs are most closely associated with state-sponsored efforts.

## 6. Your company recently purchased routers with new and updated features and deployed them in the highly secure enterprise network without changing the default settings. A few days later, the enterprise network suffered a data breach, and you are assigned to prepare a report on the data breach. Which of the following vulnerabilities should you identify as the source of the breach?

**Answer:** Using default settings.

**Explanation:** Default settings, especially default credentials, are a common vulnerability. Many attackers are aware of default configurations, which can be exploited if not changed during deployment. Unsecured management interfaces and unpatched firmware may also contribute, but the default settings are often the weakest link.

## 7. An unauthorized person recently accessed your enterprise network. The security team had received a call from the threat actor claiming to be a higher official. They followed the attacker's instructions to log them onto a specific webpage, leading to the exposure of enterprise network credentials. Which of the following social engineering techniques was used here?

**Answer:** Impersonation and phishing.

**Explanation:** The attacker pretended to be a higher official (impersonation) and tricked the team into visiting a malicious webpage (phishing), where credentials were likely stolen.

---

## 8. Which of the following is a configuration vulnerability?
  - Zero day
  - Weakest link
  - Weak encryption
  - Direct access

**Answer:** Weak encryption.

**Explanation:** Weak encryption is a configuration vulnerability because it involves choosing insecure or outdated cryptographic methods. Zero day vulnerabilities are not related to configuration, and weakest link or direct access are broader security concerns.

## 9. A federal appeals court recently made a judgment that caused significant public outrage. Soon after the ruling, the court's website was hacked, and the content was replaced with the text "Equal justice for all." Which type of threat actors attacked the court's site?

**Answer:** Hacktivists.

**Explanation:** Hacktivists use hacking to promote political or social causes. In this case, the alteration of the court’s website suggests a politically motivated attack, which is typical of hacktivism.

## 10. In cybersecurity, a threat actor is an individual or an entity responsible for cyber incidents against the technical equipment of enterprises and users. How should you differentiate an attack by a script kiddie from that of a gray hat hacker?

**Answer:** Script kiddies use automated attack software created by other hackers for personal gain, whereas gray hat hackers create their own attack software to showcase vulnerabilities present in a system to the world.

**Explanation:** Script kiddies are typically less skilled and rely on tools made by others. Gray hat hackers, on the other hand, have more expertise and may exploit systems to demonstrate vulnerabilities, often to raise awareness rather than for malicious purposes.

## 11. Which of the following is the most common method for delivering malware?
  - Identity theft
  - Removable media
  - Email
  - Social media

**Answer:** Email.

**Explanation:** Email is the most common delivery method for malware, typically through phishing emails containing malicious attachments or links. Other methods, like removable media or social media, are less frequently used.

---

## 12. Which of the following is an attack vector used by threat actors to penetrate a system?
  - Urgency
  - Email
  - Phishing
  - Intimidation

**Answer:** Email.

**Explanation:** Email is a technical attack vector used to deliver malicious software or launch phishing attacks. Urgency and intimidation are tactics used in social engineering, while phishing is a type of attack rather than an attack vector itself.

## 13. Your enterprise has played fast and loose with customer information for years. While there has been no significant breach of information that could damage the organization and/or their customers, many in the enterprise feel it is only a matter of time before a major leak occurs. Which type of threat actor is an employee who wishes to personally ensure that the enterprise is exposed and blocked from accessing their customers' information until they ensure more secure protocols?

**Answer:** Hacktivist.

**Explanation:** The employee is acting with ideological motives to expose the enterprise’s mishandling of customer information. Although an insider, the action is driven by the desire to cause change for a political or moral reason, fitting the definition of a hacktivist.

## 14. Attackers have taken over a site commonly used by an enterprise's leadership team to order new raw materials. The site is also visited by leadership at several other enterprises, so taking this site will allow for attacks on many organizations. Which type of malicious activity is this?

**Answer:** Watering hole.

**Explanation:** In a watering hole attack, attackers compromise a website frequently visited by the target group. When users visit the site, they are infected with malware or subjected to other malicious activities, as seen in this scenario.
