# Network Security and The Book of Mormon

## Ditch:Physical Locks
- Alma 49:18
    - I like this analogy. Too many times, we let people into our workspace
      without thinking about who they are, if they are authorized to be there,
      or what their intent is.

## Wall:Firewalls and Credentials
- Alma 48:8
    - Our firewalls and credentials are not failproof, never-breached items. We
      should ensure that the firewall is configured correctly and not wide-open
      by default. Also, our credentials should have enough entropy to prevent
      easy cracking. Granted, older password databases merely MD5 hashed them. I
      could not believe how fast I could crack the SAM database in my last
      class. I also could not believe how easy it was to obtain the database
      after getting into the Windows 7 VM, that also housed an out of date and
      non-patched POP server.

## Fences:Routers and Switches
- Alma 48:8
    - Network segmentation can help us greatly, as the segment particular users
      are assigned to can restrict their access to various computer resources
      throughout the network.

## Tower:Separation of Duties
- Alma 48:8=9
- Alma 50:1-5
    - Being ever watchful, meaning that users are trained and tools like
      security onion are put in place to alert us 

## Everything Together
- Alma 49:4
    - Moroni employed all of these things to defend his people.
