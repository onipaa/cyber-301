# Project 2-1 Activities and Questions:
## Step 4
This page gives a brief overview of CVE. Read through the information regarding CVE. In your own words, how would you describe it? How does it work? What advantages does it provide?

The "about CVE" page states the organization's mission, also known as Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures. It also has several podcasts that give an overview, value, and how to become CNA certified. It also describes the governing group, the Council of Roots.


## Step 7
Scroll down to CVE Entries. Describe the three elements that make up a CVE Entry.

I described all of the elements that I thought were important. There were six instead of three. See the "project-2-1.md" markdown.
