# 24 September 2024 Reading
I finished module 2 this morning; however, I know that the quiz is going to ask
questions like I poured over and memorized every sentance. Maybe I should get
used to memorizing everything I read. The only path to that end is to start
doing my BoM memorization like I have wanted to but did not. I need to get my
mind to the point that I really do memorize everything after a 1 time through
the material. I used to be much better, but COVID 3x and Cancer left me scatter
brained. Many times, it feels like my mind is going in several directions at
once.
