# National Public Data (NPD) Data Breach in 2024

The **National Public Data (NPD) breach in 2024** is one of the largest breaches in recent history, significantly impacting millions of individuals worldwide. NPD, a company primarily focused on background checks and fraud prevention, suffered a breach in December 2023, which resulted in the exposure of personal data. The breach became publicly known when the data started appearing on dark web forums in April 2024, with the leaks continuing through the summer.

## Scope of the Breach

The breach involved the exposure of around **2.9 billion records**, which included sensitive information such as:

- Full names
- Social Security Numbers (SSNs)
- Mailing addresses
- Phone numbers
- Email addresses

Security experts noted that the stolen data included **272 million unique Social Security Numbers** and other highly sensitive details. This compromised data poses a high risk for identity theft, fraud, phishing attacks, and other malicious activities.

## Attack Details

The initial breach was traced back to **December 2023**, but it was not until **April 2024** that data began leaking. Threat actors operating under aliases like "SXUL" and "USDoD" were involved in the exfiltration and sale of the data. The data was later confirmed by investigators, including **Troy Hunt** from *Have I Been Pwned* and security firm **Atlas Data Privacy Corp**, to be authentic, matching real individualsâ€™ information.

## Impacts and Legal Actions

The breach has led to multiple **class-action lawsuits** due to the widespread nature of the exposed data. Many affected individuals were unaware that their data was being stored by NPD, raising significant privacy concerns. As a result, legal experts recommend affected individuals to monitor their credit reports, place fraud alerts, and consider freezing their credit to mitigate the potential risks of identity theft.
