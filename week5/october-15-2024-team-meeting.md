# 15 October 2024 Team Meeting

## Overview

- **Task:** Submit a copy of your research notes and outline that your team has been working on for your Case Project.
- **Purpose:** Complete a milestone for this project.

Most of your reference sources will be articles found on the Internet. When you write your citations for websites, please include as many of the following items as you can: author(s), title, date written, link (URI), and the date you retrieved the page.

- Note: for this course, it's sufficient to just be consistent with your citation style. However, if anyone on your team wants to practice rigorous scholarly citation discipline, you are welcome to document your sources in one of the standard precise-citation styles (example: Turabian, MLA, APA, etc.)

With each citation, include a brief description of the source, and how it will support or contribute to your team's paper and presentation.

The purpose of your outline is to organize the structure of your paper and presentation in advance. It might be helpful to look ahead at the scoring rubric for the paper in [W10 Case Project: White Paper](https://byui.instructure.com/courses/314032/assignments/13595355), to anticipate items that might be helpful to incorporate into your outline.

Making a record of roles and responsibilities for each team member is a proven way for every student in your team to stay engaged.

- Some teams like to divide the work by assigning different items in the outline (such as narrative, analysis, recommendations, etc.) to different team members.
- Other teams prefer to divide the work by assigning different tasks (such as writing, proofreading/editing/fact-checking, making figures or illustrations, etc.) to different team members.

How you divide up the work is up to you and your team.

## Instructions

(Only one team member needs to do these steps on behalf of the entire group.)

1. Create a list of sources your team will use while writing you Case Project report.

2. Annotate your cited sources, briefly explaining how these sources bring value to your research.

3. Create an outline of your report and include it in your document.

4. List the roles/responsibilities that each team member has committed to contribute time and effort to the team's final report and presentation. Include this information in your document.

5. ###### Submit your document.
