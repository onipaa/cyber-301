### **Question 1:**  
**Which of the following is NOT a context-aware authentication?**

**Correct Answer:**  
**Trusted contacts**

**Explanation:**  
- **Context-aware authentication** uses factors such as location, device proximity, and physical detection to verify a user's identity without manual input. Examples include:
  - **Trusted places**: Authentication based on a specific location (e.g., home or office).
  - **On-body detection**: Unlocking the device when it detects it’s on a person’s body.
  - **Trusted devices**: Authentication when a known device (e.g., smartwatch) is nearby.
  - **Trusted contacts** are used for account recovery, not for context-aware authentication, making it the incorrect option.

These flashcards and detailed explanations should give you a solid study foundation! Let me know if you need any further clarifications or additional material.


I currently don't have access to external resources or specific textbooks, including the "CompTIA Security+ Guide to Network Security Fundamentals, 7th Edition." However, I can help guide you on how to find the corresponding topics in your book based on the subject areas covered in your quiz.

Here's a general guide on where you might find these topics in most **Security+** textbooks:

1. **Context-aware Authentication** – Check chapters related to **authentication methods** and **context-aware security**. This will include location-based authentication and trusted devices.
   
2. **Mobile Device Encryption** – Look for sections on **mobile device security** or **encryption methods**. Topics on full-disk encryption and file-based encryption should be covered here.

3. **Enterprise Deployment Models** (e.g., CYOD, COPE) – These concepts are usually found in chapters discussing **mobile device management** or **enterprise security policies**.

4. **Microcontrollers vs. Microprocessors** (Arduino) – Although this is more hardware-related, you may find relevant content in sections discussing **IoT (Internet of Things) devices** or **embedded systems**.

5. **Geofencing** – Look for topics on **location-based security policies** or **mobile device management**. Geofencing is commonly discussed alongside mobile application security.

6. **BAN (Body Area Network)** – This might be found in chapters related to **IoT security**, **wearable technology**, or **healthcare security systems**.

7. **Accelerometers and Sensor-based Security** – Check sections on **mobile device sensors** or **physical security**, where sensors used in mobile security (like accelerometers) are discussed.

8. **MDM (Mobile Device Management)** – Look under **mobile device security** or **enterprise mobility management** chapters. MDM is a common tool discussed in enterprise security settings.

9. **Viral Transmission Mitigation (BAN)** – This may be tied to discussions about **healthcare security** or **wearable tech security** under **IoT** or **wireless technologies**.

### How to find these in your book:
- Use the **index** in the back of your textbook to search for specific terms like "authentication," "encryption," "MDM," "IoT security," or "mobile device management."
- Look for any **chapter on mobile security** or **mobile devices**, as many of these questions revolve around mobile technology, its management, and its security.

If you have the specific chapter titles or sections of the book you are working through, I can help you map these questions to the most likely chapters/topics in more detail. Let me know if you'd like that!
